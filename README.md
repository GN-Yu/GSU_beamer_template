- *Warsaw* theme (alternatively: *Copenhagen*)
- *serif* font only for math expressions
- *structurebold* font for "large text" such as the main title, frame titles, and section entries in the table of contents.
- *infolines* outertheme (alternatively: *default*, *miniframes*, *split*, *shadow*)
- *circles* innertheme
- modified footline for each frame

## Usage
1. Clone the repository. (Or download `.zip` file from github website and unzip the file locally.)

## Suggestions
1. The [manual for beamer class](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf) is always a good reference when making beamer slides.
2. Concentrate on the content of your presentation first. 
3. Think about the frame format of the slides after you have decided on the key points of the presentation.

## Adapt to Your Organization Theme
You can easily adapt the template to feature your own organization by changing the logo and color palette.
